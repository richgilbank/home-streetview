# Home Streetview
A project to allow virtual walkthroughs using panoramic photos. Photos taken with Android's Photo Sphere feature and shrunk in Photoshop to reduce the size. 

Streetview's JS API was pretty bulky and performance was poor. This implements the functionality I was using in it (navigation, pinch to zoom, drag to look around, etc) with WebGL. 

### To run locally
